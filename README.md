# back-end-server-flights

type `npm run start` on the console to start the server on port 3000.

This is the backend server developed as the final project for the `Advanced Software Engineering` course.

The project is a website that aims to visualize the dataset in [link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zernach/2018-airplane-flights) and to provide a useful feature based on it (which we chose to be a prediction feature for the ticket price).

The server is implemented using Node.js by: 
  * Maysam M. Mousa
  * Haya Mikkawi

The main features for this project:
  * User authentication
  * Flights Visualization [Geographical heatmaps, bar charts, etc...]
  * Ticket Price Prediction

To follow the prediction feature applied to this project click the [link](https://github.com/MaysaM-M-Mousa/ticket-prediction-flight-server).

`MySQL` was used as a database server.

The following [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Abdelrahmanba/frontend) is the frontend server of our project.
